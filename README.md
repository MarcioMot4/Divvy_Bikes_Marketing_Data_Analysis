In this study, we will perform an analysis of data provided by Divvy in order to **help them on their data driven efforts to attract more annual members.** 

This is part of the work to conclude the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) as a Case Study.  The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

### Study Goals 

The challenge is to answer the following questions:

**1. How do annual members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?**

**2. Why would casual riders buy Divvy annual memberships?**

**3. How can Divvy use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**


### Tools and Methodology

The methodology used follows the Google approach to working with data, including the steps to prepare, clean, analyze, share (report) and action.

To clean, manipulate and exploit the databases, the following tools were used:

## Overal Conclusions and recommendations

#### How do annual members and casual riders use bikes differently?

*Members*
 - Use the service mostly **to commute to work, on short trips during weekdays and rush hours**

*Casual*
 - Use the service, probably **for fun and leisure, during weekends afternoons**. They like to ride **slightly longer rides**

 #### **Why would casual riders buy annual memberships?**

* Casual users that like the service and enjoy it during weekends leisure time with family, may be willing to subscribe for an annual membership in order to try to sustain a healthier lifestyle, even during workdays, when commuting to work. 

* Should them be presented with a good strategy to help achieving a healthier life, those who are already aiming it may find the support of a service they already use for leisure a good starting point.


#### **How can use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**

* Divvy can use the data for casual users to run a targeted social media ads campaign promoting the benefits of exercising regularly (at least 3x per week), and counting stories of real members that are enjoying a healthier life commuting to work on the bike share service on a regular basis.

* Besides social media, I would also use e-mail Marketing and even leaflets to be delivered on the bike stations, exclusively during the weekend for the Casual Riders. 

* Is fair to note that Chicago receives thousands of tourists who also use the shared bike services as casual riders. These should be excluded from as target on this campaign

#### **Divvy Healthier Week Challenge**
* I would also launch a huge campaign on all those medias with a Divvy Challenge daring casual users to, at least once a week, commute to work using Divvy Bikes.

* **For those who complete the challenge** during a given month, I would offer a **two month free membership**, in order to promote the creation of the good and healthier habit. 

* At the end of this free period, **chances are that those who managed to successfully create the habit, would become paying members**.
